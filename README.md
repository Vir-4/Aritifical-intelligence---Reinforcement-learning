# Aritifical-intelligence (Reinforcement-learning)

In this task, we investigated an innovative approach for solving several real-world problems that are fascinating and daunting. One in which, through contact with the external environment and awareness of a reinforcement or input signal, an agent discovers a workable solution. This field is typically referred to as reinforcement learning (RL). RL can also be used as an online way to solve the Markov Decision problem. 
This study examines the deployment of multiple forms of RL agents provided by the OpenAI gym in three different environments. This project was developed in python code, which implements various kinds of mathematical operations, Q- learning and TD- learning 
Moreover, agents are equipped with certain skills, evaluated and results are visualised using graphs. 

Steps for code execution:
1. intall pip 
2. install gym using command (!pip install gym) 
3. install any other the packages if needed. 
3. Copy and Paste the code in any python complier, Run it and you are good to go.
